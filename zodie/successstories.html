                <p class="lead">The way we met was actually a happy accident. I had not changed my location settings or my age settings from the
                    default, so Michael kind of snuck in there. So we got a match, but neither of us was really taking it seriously. Michael messaged me,
                    and we talked a little bit, and just kind of got everything big, all of our baggage, out right away so we could see if it was even
                    worth continuing to talk. I gave him my phone number and he texted me, "Hi, Freya, it's Michael." And I said: "Which Michael?" as a
                    joke. And that was it. We just talked nonstop from that point, and we went on our first date a week later. We went on a hike,
                    and we put wine in water bottles and had a little picnic at the end of the hike. Neither of us was looking for anything super-serious,
                    but we kept hanging out regularly and it just kind of happened without either of us noticing. I have a son from a previous relationship,
                    Jackson, he was 2 at the time, and they met and just really hit it off. I knew from the first date that I really, really liked Michael. It
                    was great, because I couldn't get out a lot at the time, I could get out maybe once a week, if I had a babysitter. And you're not going
                    to meet somebody at a bar if you're a single mom. So it saved me from meeting a lot of duds. Five months into dating, he proposed, but
                    we had already been talking about it for a few months. He had met my son, so we had to ask: Do we have a future? Is it worth dating
                    and building a relationship with Jackson? We decided it was worth it, obviously. I'm grateful. I don't know what I did to deserve this,
                    but I'm just going with it.

                <p class="lead">
                <p class="lead">Six months after moving to New York, I started online dating. Not necessarily because I really wanted for find a
                boyfriend; it was just me just wanting to go on dates because they were so much fun. There were points where I was going on dates
                with two or three people a week. Dating people casually, I didn't really meet anyone that I was interested in for a while. But I met
                a bunch of really interesting, great guys, who I still keep in touch with, it's hard to be real friends with them, but we're pretty
                friendly. I've set up some of the guys on dates with my girlfriends. Jensen was the one who messaged me first, and initially I never
                got back to him. Then he was ready to quit online dating, and as a last-ditch effort he sent me a message, like, Hey, I'm getting
                off this, but I wanted to message you again and see if you would at all be interested in going on a date with me. Send me a text if
                you're interested. And I actually texted him back, because I looked at his profile and saw that he was Australian, and who doesn't
                want to go on a date with an Australian babe?!

                <p class="lead">
                <p class="lead">I signed up for online dating with a friend, almost like signing up for a marathon together. I went on dates with a
                few guys, and it wasn't good. I was just not into it, and was about to quit, but then I saw this guy. I'm 5-foot-10, and I've always
                had a thing about height, and I saw this guy with a really sweet, open face, and he was 6-foot-9, I was like, This can't be real.
                Somewhere on his profile, he'd said this his favorite book was The Great Gatsby. Not a big deal, not particularly revelatory. But I
                wrote back to him and this is totally unromantic and kind of weird, this is my favorite sentence in Great Gatsby, and one of my
                favorite sentences ever, "If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
                some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of the machines that registers earthquakes tens of
                thousands of miles away." And he responded and said that he actually had a Great Gatsby sweatshirt.
